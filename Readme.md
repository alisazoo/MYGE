# MYGE

Hi, thank you for finding my first portfolio project, "MYGE". This repository is for sharing the process of my creation. This standalone application helps you to think about your interior arrangement visually, which hopefully means more clearly.
> MYGE stands for Moyo-gae (もようがえ), which means changing of interior arrangement in Japanese.


## MYGE ver.1
Launched on 25th July 2021.
### Main functions:
- Set the floor size.
- Add furniture items (as many as possible if you wish).
- Move the items on the screen (and think about your "Moyo-gae" plan visually).
  - You can rotate furniture items
  - This program automatically replaces your item if you tried to put it outside the floor area.
### What's happening next is:
- Registration: You can register the sizes of floor and furniture items.
- Natural View: The images on the screen represent the sizes of the floor and furniture items are reflected their actual size.
- Measure Distance: You can automatically understand the distance between each of the items and the edge of the floor.
- Better Data Structure of furniture items.
