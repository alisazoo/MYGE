# MYGE
Hello! Thank you for finding this program.

This is my portfolio project and this repository is created to share the process of my creation.

MYGE stands for Moyo-gae (もようがえ), which means changing of interior arrangement in Japanese, so this program will help you to plan it! 

## MYGE ver.1
- Launched on 25th July, 2021.
### Main funcitons
- Set the floor size.
- Add pieces of furniture (as many as posible if you wish).
- Move and think about your "Moyo-gae" plan visually.
  - You can rotate items
  - This program automatically allocate your item if you tried to put it outside of the room.

### In future...
- Registration: You can register the sizes of floor and pieces of furniture.
- Natural View: The floor area and each item of furniture are reflected the actual size of floor and furniture.
- Know how far: You can automatically know the distance between each item / the edge of the room.
- Better Data Structure of furniture.
